The story so far...

Started with MagicRealmData.xml from the realmspeak project

First attempt to "do something" with the data was realmspeakTiles.js
that used xml2json and hacky-slash to create realmspeakTiles.json
that I was able to use to test/boardBuilder.html.

The next attempt was also based on xml2json and tried to automate
some of the observations I made while writing realmspeakTiles.js.
Unfortunately, inconsistencies around when / where it made arrays
instead of objects scuttled the efforts in xmlJsonomnom.js.

Seeing the shortcomings of other xml to json converters, I rolled
an extremely naive and optimistic weakSauxer.js to apply some of
my own ideas on the process resulting in ugly.xml, ugly.json,
ugli.json, and finally MagicRealmData.json.

Next I'll take MagicRealmData.json and attempt to pull in tricks
from weakSauxer and realmspeakTiles to create a clean json version
of MagicRealmData.xml to use going forward. This is relma-magicaroni.js
